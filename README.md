# The script is used to loop through an annual set of trading data for stocks for each session over a year. Included in this repository is a script that will loop through all of the data and generate a summary table starting on column 10 in the same spreadsheet.  

# The original data included 7 columns of data including the ticker, date of session, the opening price, high price, low price, closing price, and volume traded for each session.  This data repeated for each day of the year across multiple tickers generating several hundred thousands of rows.  

# The output from this script will be five columns of summary data for that one year period.  This includes the ticker ID, yearly change, percent of change from the first opening and closing session, and the total stock exchanged over that one year period.  Furthermore, negative numbers will highlight in red and positive numbers in green.  The summary table that is an output from the script starts on column 10.
